indented code - more detail to distinguish lines of code that belong to a specific block from those that don't. 
indentation allows developers to quickly know that there is a code block to deal with + where a code block 
starts and ends

unindented code - more difficult to read. the developer has to pay attention to each line of code and 
each code block like "if", "else" and loop statements and how they wrap certain lines of code. the programmer 
also ends up accidentally writing code in the wrong code blocks or outside the correct blocks unless the developer 
actually looks for them
